## Documentation

To generate the documentation, you need to have **Doxygen** installed on your system.  
Once installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This command will create a new folder named `docs/`, where you can find the generated HTML documentation inside the `html/` subdirectory.
To view it, open the `index.html` file in your browser.
